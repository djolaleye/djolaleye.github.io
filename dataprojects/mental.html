      <p>Mental health has become an extremely important topic in the United States. It seems that as our way of life has changed, we have become more exposed to daily stressors. The increased burden has also come with a general increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of mental illness. There are many different illnesses that appear to be increaseing in prevalence, but the most common that I've seen are anxiety and depression. This led me to take a look at how our country stacks up against others in the extent that these diseases affect our populace. I used SQL, Python, and Tableau to inspect some of the mental health trends in America and serve as a prompt for future studies.</p>
      <p>Data Sourced from Kaggle: Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder</p>
      <p>Our first graph at the top left illustrates just how common depression has gotten in the US compared to other similarly sized countries. Prevalance data is used to provide a measure proprotional to population and allow for more accurate comparisons. We see that, over the past decade and a half, the United States and Russia stand out from the pack. These are the only countries in the world that have topped an average of 4% prevalence of depression for the time period. Whether this trend is indicative of worse environmental factors, or can be attributed to higher incidences of recognition and reporting is unclear and could be a subject for further analysis.</p>
      <p>The next bar graph demonstrates the disparity in the types of mental health issues Americans are facing. Anxiety and depression are by far the most common afflictions, combining to account for over 10% of all mental health diagnoses - while no other solitary illness contributes even up to 1%. Their frequency suggests that dedicating a proportionate amount of resources towards these areas would be an impactful strategy.
        The line graph in the bottom left brings a bit more context surrounding anxiety. We see that the percentage of Females presenting with an anxiety disorder has risen consistently, while no such pattern has been seen in Males - who have remained relatively constant. This growing trend may necessitate an extra focus on targeting the demographic showing elevated incidence. However, the possibility of social  factors playing a role in the difference can't be ignored. Lower probabilities of reporting from Men could affect the true representation.</p>
      <p>Lastly, we have a scatter plot relating drug/alcohol abuse rates and depression. Though the correlations are not particularly linear, that might be a consequence of measuring depression rate as per 100,000 people with no other control for vastly different population sizes. Despite this, the quadrants provide a good overview of which category a country finds itself in: high drug/alcohol use + high depression, high drug/alcohol use + low depression, low drug/alcohol use + high depression, low drug/alcohol use + low depression. The United States shows up in the upper right quadrant for both metrics. Further parsing out the role that addictive behaviors play in predicting depression, or other mental health disorders, would be a worthwile next step.</p>
      <p>Overall, it's clear that the United states of America is unique in the degree of challenges we face regarding our mental health. The vast size of our country, and many particularities between regions, makes the search for solutions a complex one. Exploring how our different lifestyle factors and societal structure contribute to the mental health of our citizens should be a priority to reverse the trend for future generations.</p>

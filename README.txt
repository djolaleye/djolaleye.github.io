I’m excited by projects where analytics and creative software design meet, finding and visualizing new insights.

Right now, I'm studying Artificial Intelligence and Performance Engineering as a Masters student at UIUC.

Previously I've worked in Fraud Strategy at Discover (Capital One), and as a medical laboratory scientist in Microbiology.
